# eg. when terminal window with an active zellij session is closed
# Options:
#   - detach (Default)
#   - quit
#on_force_close: quit

# Send a request for a simplified ui (without arrow fonts) to plugins
# Options:
#   - true
#   - false (Default)
#simplified_ui: true

# Choose the path to the default shell that zellij will use for opening new panes
# Default: $SHELL
default_shell: zsh

# Toggle between having pane frames around the panes
# Options:
#   - true (default)
#   - false
pane_frames: false

# Choose the theme that is specified in the themes section.
# For some examples, see: https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/tree/main/example/themes
# Default: default
theme: one-half-dark

# Configure the scroll back buffer size
# This is the number of lines zellij stores for each pane in the scroll back
# buffer. Excess number of lines are discarded in a FIFO fashion.
# Valid values: positive integers
# Default value: 10000
scroll_buffer_size: 100000

# Provide a command to execute when copying text. The text will be piped to
# the stdin of the program to perform the copy. This can be used with
# terminal emulators which do not support the OSC 52 ANSI control sequence
# that will be used by default if this option is not set.
# Examples:
#copy_command: "xclip -selection clipboard" # x11
#copy_command: "wl-copy"                    # wayland
#copy_command: "pbcopy"                     # osx

# Choose the destination for copied text
# Allows using the primary selection buffer (on x11/wayland) instead of the system clipboard.
# Does not apply when using copy_command.
# Options:
#   - system (default)
#   - primary
#copy_clipboard: primary

# Enable or disable automatic copy (and clear) of selection when releasing mouse
#copy_on_select: true

# Path to the default editor to use to edit pane scrollbuffer
